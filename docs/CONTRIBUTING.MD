## Step 0: Clone project into local directory

Make a local directory somewhere on your computer

Then run `git clone https://github.com/MichaelGrigoryan25/reposs.git`

Type `yarn` to install all the packages

## Step 1: Have a running version on your system

Type `yarn start` to start local server

Then, test to make sure running version is working properly

Use this [link](https://github.com/MichaelGrigoryan25/reposs) to fork the repo to
your profile

## Step 4: Add your remote branch

Switch to dev branch by running `git switch dev`

Create a branch in your forked repo, name it `dev-<your-name>-<number-of-patches>`

*example: `dev-gitter499-0`*

Go back to your local repo and add remote branch by typing `git remote add origin <your-fork-url>`

Then type `git fetch` to sync

## Step 5: Developing

Pickout an issue or feature request, add your changes (*Note: Some changes may require repo owner permission*). 

## Step 6: Testing your changes

Test the changes on your local machine, make sure there aren't any errors, and fully interact with the changes you made. (*Testing tip: Make sure changes look good on all screens*)

## Step 7: Adding your changes

Stage your changes and make a clear and concise commit message detailing what you did. You can also choose to document your changes further in Github.

## Step 8: Pushing changes and creating a pull request

Push your changes to your fork repo and refresh the page on GitHub. Press the 'Compare and Pull Request" button in order to make a PR. Review your changes and add any additional documentation. 

Finally, create your PR.

## Step 9: Getting your changes reviewed and approved

A maintainer or a code reviewer will review your changes and merge them. A reviewer will close the PR if they think the PR is unneccasary or unstable.
